# CORS Proxy URL (optional)
# Use a CORS proxy service to bypass browser CORS restrictions during development
# Alternative proxies:
# - https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url= (stable, URL encoded)
# - https://corsproxy.io/? (currently blocking requests)
# - https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy?quest= (reliable)
