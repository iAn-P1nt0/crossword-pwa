# Enable remote puzzle source downloads (bypasses local dev guard)
# WARNING: This will trigger CORS errors and auth failures for sources that require credentials
# Set to "true" to test actual puzzle downloads from registered sources
VITE_ENABLE_REMOTE_SOURCES=true

# CORS Proxy URL (optional)
# Use a CORS proxy service to bypass browser CORS restrictions during development
# Alternative proxies (best for binary files like .puz):
# - https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ (need to request access first)
# - https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/ (good for binary)
# - https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy?quest= (reliable but may have issues with binary)
# Leave empty to make direct requests (will fail with CORS errors)
